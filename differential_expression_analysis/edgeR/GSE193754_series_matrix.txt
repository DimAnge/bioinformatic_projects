!Series_summary	"The activation status of some DNA damage repair proteins is closely related to the efficacy of CDDP chemotherapy in MIBC. In this study, we used CRISPR/cas9 gene-editing technology to construct hMSH2-deficient bladder cancer cells and confirmed that loss of hMSH2 decreased the sensitivity of bladder cancer cells to cisplatin. Transcriptome analysis was performed to find the potential genes that could be regulated by hMSH2."
!Series_overall_design	"In order to screen downstream genes regulated by hMSH2, transcriptome analysis was performed in hMSH2-deficient EJ cells and compaired wild-type EJ cells."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
