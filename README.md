Bioinformatics Projects - Script Repository
Overview

Welcome to my Bioinformatics and Computational Biology repository. 

This repository contains scripts and analyses that I am developing as I am pursuing my Master's degree in 'Bioinformatics - Computational Biology'. The main goal is to improve my bioinformatic skills by performing various analyses, such as differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment, and other computational biology techniques.
