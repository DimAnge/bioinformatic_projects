# Bioinformatics Projects - Script Repository
## Overview

Welcome to my Bioinformatics and Computational Biology repository. 

Repository for writing/practising code and developing tools that will help me at my pursuit in a career in bioinformatics. The main goal is to improve my bioinformatic skills by performing nalyses, such as differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment, and developing various tools in the field of computational biology.

### Mini Projects

#### Differentional Expression Analysis
