Bioinformatics Projects - Script Repository
Overview

Welcome to my Bioinformatics and Computational Biology repository. 

Repository for writing/practising code and developing tools that will help me at my pursuit in a career in bioinformatics. The main goal is to improve my bioinformatic skills by performing various analyses, such as differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment, and other computational biology techniques.
